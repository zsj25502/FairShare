# FairShare

The developmental cross-platform mobile application for Share Yourself Artists, powered by React Native.
Created by the FairShare Team, CMPS 116 Winter 2019.

### Prerequisites

The current version of the mobile application is built with the following dependencies:

React: 16.6.3,
React-native: 0.58.3

The application has not been tested with newer or older versions of the React Native.

### Building the Application

To build and run the application for either platform, run `react-native run-android` or `react-native run-ios` from the root of the project directory.

Developers need to either download the Android Emulator and/or Xcode,
or plug in their device to run the application.

Windows, Linux, and Mac OS can be used for development. However, the application can only be ran on the Android Emulator for Windows/Linux users,
while Mac OS users can run the application on both platforms.

If an error is encountered during build or run time, try running `npm install` and rebuilding the application.
